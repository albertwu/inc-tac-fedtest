# inc-tac-fedtest

The Federation Test Environment Working Group is chartered by the InCommon Technical Advisory Committee to identify and prioritize relevant testing and validation best practices, procedures, tooling, and environments when:

* An existing or prospective InCommon Participant integrates services (identity provider and service provider) via the InCommon Federation 
* The InCommon federation operator introduces changes to federation infrastructure
